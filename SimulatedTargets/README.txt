This go program sets up a websocket connection as a simulated VMT target to a VMTServer.
Once the connection is established, a simulated Target Supply Chain definition is 
created and sent to the server.
The default simulated Supply Chain definition contains a seller entity of type Physical Machine
and a buyer entity of type Virtual Machine. 
The default topology which will be discovered by the VMTServer is 2 Physical Machine sellers;
the first PM sells two different virtual machines and the second PM sells to one virtual machine.



Before running this program:

-Get your local IP address and update the local_IP variable in the main() function
-Get the IP address of the VMTServer host you want to connect to
and update the VMTServer_IP variable in the main() function.
-Create an arbitrary identifier for this simulated target and update the TargetIdentifier variable

To Modify the Default Supply Chain:
-The function createSupplyChain() includes comments explaining how to add entity types  with their 
 respective relationship to other entity types.
 Other available EntityDTO_EntityType which can be added to the supply chain can be found in
 vmturbo-go-sdk/sdk/CommonDTO.pb.go
-The steps are: create a supplyChainNodeBuilder instance with sdk.NewSupplyChainNodeBuilder() , 
 set the supplyChainNodeBuilder object's EntityDTO_EntityType and other properties, add the 
 supplyChainNodeBuilder instance to the supplyChain Builder.

To Modify the Default Topology:
-The method SampleProbe() defines the targets topology (entities and their properties with relationships
 to each other).
-To add entities create new Entity_Params objects with the corresponding fields set and add the entities
 to the entities array. Only one entities array is used in this method.
